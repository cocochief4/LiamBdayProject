# Birthday Nerf War Beacon

Hi! Here is the YouTube video for this project:

If you were redirected by the video to here, this is how to access the code:

## Microbit File (.hex):
1. Download the code (zip or on git desktop, either one works, just make sure to unzip)
2. Find the Makecode. It will be in the /src file.

	To view the actual block code, go to: https://makecode.microbit.org/#. On the right, there will be a button that says "import". Click that, and choose to import file. Select the file, and you should see the setup of the code as shown below.

## Arduino File (.ino)
1. Download the code (zip or on git desktop, either one works, just make sure to unzip)
2. Find the .ino file. It will be in the /src file.

	Make sure you have the Arduino editor which you can find here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
