# Birthday Nerf War Beacon

Hi! Here is the YouTube video for this project:

If you were redirected by the video to here, this is how to access the code:

1. Download the code (zip or on git desktop, either one works, just make sure to unzip)
2. Find the Arduino Code or Makecode, whichever one you are looking for. They are both in the /src file.

	If you are opening the .ino file, make sure you have the Arduino editor which you can find here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software. If you are opening the Microbit .hex file, to view the actual block code, go to: https://makecode.microbit.org/#. On the right, there will be a button that says "import". Click that, and choose to import file. Select the file, and you should see the setup of the code as shown below.
